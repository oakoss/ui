React Aria UI provides accessible, customizable React components built on [React Aria Components](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/components.html).

## Features

- **Accessible by default** - Built on React Aria's battle-tested accessibility primitives
- **Customizable** - Style with Tailwind CSS, override with your own classes
- **Copy-paste** - Distributed via shadcn registry, own your components
- **TypeScript first** - Full type safety with React 19 support

## Quick Start

Components are distributed via the shadcn registry. Add them to your project:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.oakoss.com/r/button
```

Or copy the source directly into your project.
